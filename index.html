<p class="EduText"> I am taking my current education in Denmark at Zealand Academy. In here I got hands on experience in programming and learned how project work really is.  We have been tasked to deliver a solution for a real problem of a real company. During my studies  learned XAML, HTML, CSS, C#, SQL and Javascript as well. I got an overall understanding on the Agile software devepment process. During the project works we've been using XP and SCRUM. </p>

  <p class="EduText"> 
    After a few months in Netto, I got promoted to a First Assistant. I've been working at multiple stores around Zealand
    and I felt like, despite the fact that I'm not a Dane, my work was more than appreciated all the time. Danish people are very supportive and encouraging.
    Since this period started, I became responsible for a store and for a team, therefore I gained experience in team-leading, and 
    my time-management skill significantly improved.<br>
    I'm really thankful for all the supportive customers I have gotten. :)

    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="EduText"> 
    In the beggining of the COVID-19 outbrake and quarantine-period I really wanted to try to find a way to help people, who are
    risked or affacted by the virus. As a student I didn't have too much possibilties, but I decided to apply to Netto, so I can
    help people day by day. At Netto, I met a wonderful team, and I got a taste from the danish culture.<br>
    During my work in Netto as a Sales Assistant I gained really important practical skills regarding my future.
